      "The Regulation 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods6 (hereinafter \"the \n",
      "Regulation\") entered into force on 19th January 2007. \n",
      "Article 13 of the Regulation foresees that the Commission shall adopt a Community list of permitted \n",
      "health claims other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children's development \n",
      "and health. This Community list shall be adopted through the Regulatory Committee procedure and \n",
      "following consultation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). \n",
      "Health claims are defined as \"any claim that states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists \n",
      "between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health\".  \n",
      "In accordance with Article 13 (1) health claims other than those referring to the reduction of disease \n",
      "risk and to children's development and health are health claims describing or referring to:  \n",
      "a) the role of a nutrient or other substance in growth, development and the functions of the \n",
      "body; or \n",
      "b) psychological and behavioural functions; or \n",
      "c) without prejudice to Directive 96/8/EC, slimming or weight-control or a reduction in the \n",

      "energy from the diet. \n",
      "To be included in the Community list of permitted health claims, the claims shall be:  \n",
      "(i) based on generally accepted scientific evidence; and \n",
      "(ii) well understood by the average consumer. \n",
      "Member States provided the Commission with lists of claims as referred to in Article 13 (1) by 31 \n",
      "January 2008 accompanied by the conditions applying to them and by references to the relevant \n",
      "scientific justification. These lists have been consolidated into the list which forms the basis for the \n",
      "EFSA consultation in accordance with Article 13 (3).  \n",
      "ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED \n",
      "IMPORTANCE AND PERTINENCE OF THE FOOD7  \n",
      "Foods are commonly involved in many different functions8 of the body, and for one single food many \n",
      "health claims may therefore be scientifically true. Therefore, the relative importance of food e.g. \n",
      "nutrients in relation to other nutrients for the expressed beneficial effect should be considered: for \n",
      "functions affected by a large number of dietary factors it should be considered whether a reference to \n",
      "a single food is scientifically pertinent.  \n",
      "                                                     \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "6 OJ  L12, 18/01/2007 \n",
      "7 The term 'food' when used in this Terms of Reference refers to a food constituent, the food or the food category.  \n",
      "It should also be considered if the information on the characteristics of the food contains aspects \n",
      "pertinent to the beneficial effect.  \n",
      "SUBSTANTIATION OF CLAIMS BY GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE \n",
      "Scientific substantiation is the main aspect to be taken into account to authorise health claims. Claims \n",
      "should be scientifically substantiated by taking into account the totality of the available scientific \n",
      "data, and by weighing the evidence, and shall demonstrate the extent to which: \n",
      "(a) \n",
      "the claimed effect of the food is beneficial for human health, \n",
      "(b) \n",
      "a cause and effect relationship is established between consumption of the food and the \n",
      "claimed effect in humans (such as: the strength, consistency, specificity, dose-\n",
      "response, and biological plausibility of the relationship), \n",
      "(c) \n",
      "the quantity of the food and pattern of consumption required to obtain the claimed \n",
      "effect could reasonably be achieved as part of a balanced diet, \n",
      "(d) \n",
      "the specific study group(s) in which the evidence was obtained is representative of the \n",
      "target population for which the claim is intended. \n",
      "EFSA has mentioned in its scientific and technical guidance for the preparation and presentation of \n",
      "the application for authorisation of health claims consistent criteria for the potential sources of \n",
      "scientific data. Such sources may not be available for all health claims. Nevertheless it will be \n",
      "relevant and important that EFSA comments on the availability and quality of such data in order to \n",
      "allow the regulator to judge and make a risk management decision about the acceptability of health \n",
      "claims included in the submitted list. \n",
      "The scientific evidence about the role of a food on a nutritional or physiological function is not \n",
      "enough to justify the claim. The beneficial effect of the dietary intake has also to be demonstrated. \n",
      "Moreover, the beneficial effect should be significant i.e. satisfactorily demonstrate to beneficially \n",
      "affect identified functions in the body in a way which is relevant to health. Although an appreciation \n",
      "of the beneficial effect in relation to the nutritional status of the European population may be of \n",
      "interest, the presence or absence of the actual need for a nutrient or other substance with nutritional or \n",
      "physiological effect for that population should not, however, condition such considerations. \n",
      "Different types of effects can be claimed. Claims referring to the maintenance of a function may be \n",
      "distinct from claims referring to the improvement of a function. EFSA may wish to comment whether \n",
      "such different claims comply with the criteria laid down in the Regulation. \n",
      "WORDING OF HEALTH CLAIMS \n",
      "Scientific substantiation of health claims is the main aspect on which EFSA's opinion is requested. \n",
      "However, the wording of health claims should also be commented by EFSA in its opinion. \n",
      "There is potentially a plethora of expressions that may be used to convey the relationship between the \n",
      "food and the function. This may be due to commercial practices, consumer perception and linguistic \n",
      "or cultural differences across the EU. Nevertheless, the wording used to make health claims should be \n",
      "truthful, clear, reliable and useful to the consumer in choosing a healthy diet. \n",
      "In addition to fulfilling the general principles and conditions of the Regulation laid down in Article 3 \n",
      "and 5, Article 13(1)(a) stipulates that health claims shall describe or refer to \"the role of a nutrient or \n",
      "other substance in growth, development and the functions of the body\". Therefore, the requirement to \n",
      "describe or refer to the 'role' of a nutrient or substance in growth, development and the functions of \n",
      "the body should be carefully considered. \n",
      "The specificity of the wording is very important. Health claims such as \"Substance X supports the \n",
      "function of the joints\" may not sufficiently do so, whereas a claim such as \"Substance X helps \n",
      "maintain the flexibility of the joints\" would. In the first example of a claim it is unclear which of the \n",
      "various functions of the joints is described or referred to contrary to the latter example which \n",
      "specifies this by using the word \"flexibility\". \n",
      "The clarity of the wording is very important. The guiding principle should be that the description or \n",
      "reference to the role of the nutrient or other substance shall be clear and unambiguous and therefore \n",
      "be specified to the extent possible i.e. descriptive words/ terms which can have multiple meanings \n",
      "should be avoided. To this end, wordings like \"strengthens your natural defences\" or \"contain \n",
      "antioxidants\" should be considered as well as \"may\" or \"might\" as opposed to words like \n",
      "\"contributes\", \"aids\" or \"helps\".  \n",
      "In addition, for functions affected by a large number of dietary factors it should be considered \n",
      "whether wordings such as \"indispensable\", \"necessary\", \"essential\" and \"important\" reflects the \n",
      "strength of the scientific evidence. \n",
      "Similar alternative wordings as mentioned above are used for claims relating to different relationships \n",
      "between the various foods and health. It is not the intention of the regulator to adopt a detailed and \n",
      "rigid list of claims where all possible wordings for the different claims are approved. Therefore, it is \n",
      "not required that EFSA comments on each individual wording for each claim unless the wording is \n",
      "strictly pertinent to a specific claim. It would be appreciated though that EFSA may consider and \n",
      "comment generally on such elements relating to wording to ensure the compliance with the criteria \n",
      "laid down in the Regulation. \n",
      "In doing so the explanation provided for in recital 16 of the Regulation on the notion of the average \n",
      "consumer should be recalled. In addition, such assessment should take into account the particular \n",
      "perspective and/or knowledge in the target group of the claim, if such is indicated or implied. \n",

      "HEALTH CLAIMS OTHER THAN THOSE REFERRING TO THE REDUCTION OF DISEASE RISK AND TO \n",

      " Whether adequate information is provided on the characteristics of the food pertinent to the \n",
      "beneficial effect. \n",
      " Whether the beneficial effect of the food on the function is substantiated by generally \n",
      "accepted scientific evidence by taking into account the totality of the available scientific data, \n",

There is evidence that impaired fatty acid metabolism secondary to reduced activities of the biotin dependent carboxylases (especially acetyl CoA carboxylase) plays an aetiological role in the dermatological manifestation of biotin deficiency (Mock, 1991).

The Panel notes that in this study no objective methods were used to determine the improvement in hair loss and hair quality. Symptoms of biotin deficiency include thinning of hair and progression to loss of all hair, including eyebrows and lashes. Growth of normal hair generally appears after one or two months of treatment of the deficiency (Mock, 2005).
