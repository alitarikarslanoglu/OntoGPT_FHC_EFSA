Scientific Substantiation:
Protection against heavy metals (ID 383)  One reference was provided for the scientific substantiation of the claim which was a textbook in 
which the claimed effect was mentioned. No further evidence was provided in support of the claim. 
The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from this reference for the scientific 
substantiation of the claimed effect. 
The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary 
intake of selenium and protection against heavy metals. 
3.4.

Conditions and Restrictions:
Conditions and possible restrictions of use 
The Panel considers that in order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of selenium as 
per Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a 
balanced diet. The target population is the general population. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) 
have been established for adults, pregnant and lactating woman, children and adolescents (SCF, 
2000). 


Conclusions:
Protection against heavy metals (ID 383)  
 
The claimed effect is “detoxification”. The target population is assumed to be the general 
population. Protection against heavy metals is a beneficial physiological effect. 
 
A cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary intake of 
selenium and protection against heavy metals.
