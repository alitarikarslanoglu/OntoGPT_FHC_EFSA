    "scientific_substantiation": "Scientific substantiation of the claimed effect \nSelenium is an essential trace element. Twenty-five selenoprotein genes have been identified in the \nhuman genome (Kryukov et al., 2003). Selenoproteins have a number of functions, comprising \nvarious catalytic roles (glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductases, and iodothyronine \ndeiodinases), structural roles, and storage and transport activities. Selenium is present in foods mainly \nas selenomethionine and selenocysteine. It is absorbed efficiently by the intestine over a wide range of \nconcentrations and across a variety of different molecular forms (Bates, 2005). \n3.1. \nMaintenance of normal hair (ID 281) \nDeficiency in selenium has been shown to result in various disorders including impairment of hair \n(Biesalski et al., 1995; Sunde, 2006). Clinical manifestations such as white nail beds, pseudoalbinism, \nalopecia and thin hair have been observed in particular in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition \nlacking selenium. Administration of selenium was able to restore these deficiency symptoms (Abrams \net al., 1992; Kanekura et al., 2005; Masumoto et al., 2007; Vinton et al., 1987). \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of selenium and maintenance of normal hair. However, the evidence provided does not \nestablish that inadequate intake of selenium leading to impaired maintenance of normal hair occurs in \nthe general EU population. \n3.2. \nMaintenance of normal nails (ID 281) \nDeficiency in selenium has been shown to result in various disorders including impairment of nails \n(Biesalski et al., 1995; Sunde, 2006). Clinical manifestations such as white nail beds, pseudoalbinism, \nalopecia and thin hair have been observed in particular in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition \nlacking selenium. Administration of selenium was able to restore these deficiency symptoms (Abrams \net al., 1992; Kanekura et al., 2005; Masumoto et al., 2007; Vinton et al., 1987). \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of selenium and maintenance of normal nails However, the evidence provided does not \nestablish that inadequate intake of selenium leading to impaired maintenance of normal nails occurs in \nthe general EU population. \n3.3. \nProtection against heavy metals (ID 383) \nOne reference was provided for the scientific substantiation of the claim which was a textbook in \nwhich the claimed effect was mentioned. No further evidence was provided in support of the claim. \nThe Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from this reference for the scientific \nsubstantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary \nintake of selenium and protection against heavy metals. \n3.4. \nMaintenance of normal joints (ID 409) \nA total of 15 references were provided for the scientific substantiation of the claim. Ten human \nstudies assessed plasma selenium concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, (juvenile) \nadult T-cell leukaemia. Five human intervention studies have been provided which were carried out in \npatients with rheumatoid arthritis or chronic polyarthritis. The Panel considers that the evidence \nprovided does not establish that patients with arthritis of different origin are representative of the \ngeneral population with regard to the status of joint tissue, or that results obtained in studies on \nsubjects with arthritis of different origin relating to the treatment of symptoms of these diseases can \nbe extrapolated to the maintenance of normal joints in the general population. \nThe Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from these references for the scientific \nsubstantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary \nintake of selenium and maintenance of normal joints. \n4. \nPanel\u2019s ",
    "conditions_restrictions": "Conditions and possible restrictions of use \nThe Panel considers that in order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of selenium as \nper Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a \nbalanced diet. The target population is the general population. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) \nhave been established for adults, pregnant and lactating woman, children and adolescents (SCF, \n2000). \n",
    "conclusions": "CONCLUSIONS \nOn the basis of the data presented, the Panel concludes that: \uf0b7\n \nThe food constituent, selenium, which is the subject of the health claims is sufficiently \ncharacterised. \nMaintenance of normal hair (ID 281) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201chair and nail formation\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the \ngeneral population. Maintenance of normal hair is a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of selenium \nand maintenance of normal hair. \uf0b7\n \nThe evidence provided does not establish that inadequate intake of selenium leading to \nimpaired maintenance of normal hair occurs in the general EU population. \uf0b7\n \nThe following wording reflects the scientific evidence: \u201cSelenium contributes to the \nmaintenance of normal hair\u201d. \nMaintenance of normal nails (ID 281) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201chair and nail formation\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the \ngeneral population. Maintenance of normal nails is a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of selenium \nand maintenance of normal nails. \uf0b7\n \nThe evidence provided does not establish that inadequate intake of selenium leading to \nimpaired maintenance of normal nails occurs in the general EU population. \uf0b7\n \nThe following wording reflects the scientific evidence: \u201cSelenium contributes to the \nmaintenance of normal nails\u201d. \nProtection against heavy metals (ID 383) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cdetoxification\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the general \npopulation. Protection against heavy metals is a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary intake of \nselenium and protection against heavy metals. \nMaintenance of normal joints (ID 409) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cjoint function\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the general \npopulation. Maintenance of normal joints is a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary intake of \nselenium and maintenance of normal joints. \nMaintenance of normal thyroid function (ID 410, 1292) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effects are \u201ckey function within metabolism (e.g. GSH-peroxidase)\u201d, \n\u201cantioxidant to prevent oxidative stress\u201d, \u201cproper thyroid function\u201d, and \u201cmaintenance of \ncellular redox status. The target population is assumed to be the general population. \uf0b7\n \nA claim on selenium and normal thyroid function has already been assessed with a \nfavourable outcome. \nProtection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage (ID 410, 1292) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effects are \u201ckey function within metabolism (e.g. GSH-peroxidase)\u201d, \n\u201cantioxidant to prevent oxidative stress\u201d, \u201cproper thyroid function\u201d, and \u201cmaintenance of \ncellular redox status\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the general population. \uf0b7\n \nA claim on selenium and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage has \nalready been assessed with a favourable outcome. \nMaintenance of the normal function of the immune system (ID 1750) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cnatural defences/immune system\u201d. The target population is assumed to \nbe the general population. \uf0b7\n \nA claim on selenium and normal function of the immune system has already been assessed \nwith a favourable outcome. \nConditions and possible restrictions of use \uf0b7\n \nIn order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of selenium as per Annex to \nRegulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a balanced \ndiet. The target population is the general population. \n",
