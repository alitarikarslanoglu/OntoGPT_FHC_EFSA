      "  evidence: Some mechanisms have been proposed for an effect of dietary calcium on blood pressure on the basis of experimental animal models of hypertension (Hatton and McCarron, 1994). The effects of dietary calcium intake on blood pressure have also been investigated in humans. A meta-analysis of 23 observational epidemiological studies (total of 38,950 subjects) showed a weak significant negative association between habitual calcium intake and blood pressure, i.e. -0.39 mmHg systolic and -0.34 mmHg diastolic per 100 mg of dietary calcium per day (Cappuccio et al., 1995; Birkett, 1998). In contrast, in a more recent study, dietary calcium intake was positively associated with changes in blood pressure over 8 years in 1,714 middle-aged men from the Chicago Western Electric Study (Stamler et al., 2002). The mean calcium intake in this cohort was 1,019 (SD 446) mg/d. Calcium intake was not related to blood pressure in 3,239 participants aged 55 years and over in the Rotterdam Study, except for a subgroup of hypertensive subjects where an inverse association was found (Geleijnse et al, 1996). Wang et al. (2008) examined the relationship of dietary calcium intake with incident hypertension in 28,886 US women. Daily calcium intake ranged from <558 mg (bottom quintile) to >1000 mg (upper quintile). The risk of hypertension was 11-13% lower in subjects with a calcium intake >679 mg/day. The evidence provided by several meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (Allender et al., 1996; Bucher et al., 1996; Griffith et al., 1999; Van Mierlo et al., 2006) indicates a small beneficial effect of calcium supplementation on blood pressure.

Six references were textbook or opinions of scientific bodies and 47 references were not directly related to the claimed effect but to blood homocysteine concentrations, insulin sensitivity, markers of oxidative stress or to the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and the risk of cardiovascular disease. One meta-analysis, three review papers and 16 human studies investigating the relationship between folic acid intake and endothelial function were cited. 15 of the human studies were conducted with high doses of folic acid (5 mg/d, 10 mg/d or 20 mg/d). In a randomised double blind placebo controlled parallel design intervention, 56 subjects with coronary artery disease not exposed to folate fortification were randomised to receive either a low dose (400 µg/d) (n= 20) or high dose (5 mg/d) of folic acid (n=22) or placebo (n=14) for 7 weeks before coronary artery bypass grafting. Vascular function was quantified by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Images of the aorta and carotid arteries were used to determine vascular distensibility and pulse-wave velocity as indices of vascular stiffness. FMD was used as a measure of endothelial function. Supplementation with both low and high doses of folic acid significantly improved aortic and carotid distensibility, reduced aortic pulsewave velocity, and increased FMD compared with placebo (Shirodaria et al., 2007). The meta-analysis included 14 randomised controlled trials. One trial had two intervention groups and thus 15 intervention groups were analysed. In total, this meta-analysis was based on 732 persons treated with folic acid (either alone or in combination with vitamin B6, vitamin B12, or both) or placebo for a median duration of 8 weeks and with a median study size of 34 participants. Most study participants were middle-aged males (median age 55.8 years, 86% males). The median folic acid dose was 5000 µg/d (range: 400–10,000 µg/d). The primary outcome was the net change in flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) induced by the supplementation with folic acid (either alone or in combination with vitamin B6, vitamin B12, or both). Supplementation with folic acid significantly improved FMD when all studies were considered together. Trials using lower doses of folic acid (400 - 800 µg/d, 4 intervention groups) did not show a significant beneficial effect of folic acid intake on FMD, whereas the studies using doses ≥5000 µg/d (11 intervention groups) did (de Bree et al., 2007).\n",

      "  evidence: 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate is an important functional and regulatory component of the folate-dependent pathway for the production of methionine from homocysteine which is catalysed by methionine synthase. In this reaction, a methyl group is sequentially transferred from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to the cobalamin coenzyme of the methionine synthase, and then to homocysteine to form methionine (Bailey and Gregory, 2006). Under conditions of maximal metabolic efficiency, plasma concentrations of homocysteine range from 4 to 10 µmol/L. Metabolic blocks in homocysteine metabolism lead to accumulation of intracellular homocysteine with subsequent export into the blood. Depending on the magnitude of the metabolic impairment, plasma homocysteine can rise to varying degrees. Hyperhomocysteinemia is also caused by B vitamin deficiencies. Deficiencies of folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 lead to impaired remethylation of homocysteine causing mild, moderate, or severe elevations in plasma homocysteine, depending on the severity of the deficiency, as well as coexistence of genetic or other factors that interfere with homocysteine metabolism (Miller, 2005).\n",

      "  evidence: Fluoride is a highly electronegative ion, which may replace hydroxyl ions in the hydroxyapatite crystal lattice of tooth tissues (Robinson et al., 2000; ten Cate et al., 2008). Tooth hydroxyapatite crystals are resistant to dissolution at neutral pH, but their solubility drastically increases as pH drops (ten Cate et al., 2008). This drop in pH may lead to a net loss of tooth minerals. Fluoride substituted apatite is less soluble, and hence more resistant to acid exposure (Aoba, 2004). Maintenance of tooth mineralisation is affected by the availability of ionic calcium, phosphate and fluoride at the tooth crystal interface. As long as a state of ionic supersaturation or equilibrium is maintained tooth mineral is not lost and may even be gained. The evidence provided by consensus opinions/reports from authoritative bodies, reviews, and scientific original papers shows that fluoride is beneficial for tooth health in the entire population by counteracting hydroxyapatite demineralisation and supporting remineralisation, i.e. maintenance of tooth mineralisation (Dean, 1942; ten Cate et al., 2008; Benson et al., 2009; Gillespie, 2009; Griffin et al., 2007; Hattab et al., 1989; Hjortsjö et al., 2009; NIH, 2001; ten Cate, 2004; Yeung et al., 2005).\n",
