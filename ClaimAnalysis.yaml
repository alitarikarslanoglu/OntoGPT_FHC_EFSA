            Extract the evidence (including all citations) from the text below. Include both supporting and contradicting evidence.
              1. Take a long-form, highly detailed and descriptive approach. Avoid adding your own analysis, summarization.
              2. Incorporate, for study cited, all details pertaining to:
                2.1 the type of clinical studies
                2.2 mechanism of actions
                2.3 dosages used in the study, including amounts and frequency
                2.4 efficacy
                2.5 limitations.
              3. Overall assessment, evidence weighting, and conclusion drawn by the panel.
              2. Include all citations of references to journal articles in the text, as they appear in context of the evidence.
              3. Output as ONE block/paragraph of plain text, without quotes. Note that terms like "ID 460", "ID 320", etc. are not journal citations so ignore these.
