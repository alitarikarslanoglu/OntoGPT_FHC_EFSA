      "Supporting Evidence: Clinical trials comparing the effects of different vegetable oils on serum lipids in normolipidaemic subjects have shown that the effect of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) on serum cholesterol is similar to that of linoleic acid (LA) (Mantzioris et al., 1994; Valsta et al., 1995; Pand et al., 1998). In a meta-analysis of 60 randomised controlled clinical trials, the replacement of 1% of energy from carbohydrates by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), mainly as LA, reduced serum LDL cholesterol levels by 0.02 mmol/l (Mensink et al., 2003). The estimated change in the total to HDL cholesterol ratio was -0.032. Although LA was the main source of PUFA in the studies above, smaller amounts of ALA were also used in some of the studies. Moreover, as indicated in the studies by Mantzioris et al. (1994), Valsta et al. (1995) and Pand et al. (1998), the effects of LA and ALA on serum lipoproteins are similar and the n-6/n-3 ratio of dietary PUFA does not affect the serum lipid profile (Goyens and Mensink, 2005). The Panel considers that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of ALA and the reduction of blood cholesterol concentrations.\n",

      "Supporting Evidence: Two human intervention studies investigated the effects of fructose on post-prandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses compared to other carbohydrates (Bantle et al., 1983; Crapo et al., 1980). In a test meal study by Bantle et al. (1983), 10 healthy subjects, 12 patients with type 1 diabetes, and 10 patients with type 2 diabetes (none taking oral hypoglycaemic medications) received in a random order five test breakfasts containing 42-43 g of different test carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, sucrose, potato starch and wheat starch) and nearly identical amounts of energy (685-742 kcal), of total carbohydrates (84-89 g), of protein (31-38 g) and of fat (25-26 g). Blood samples were obtained at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after each breakfast. In healthy and type 2 diabetic subjects, the breakfast containing fructose induced significantly smaller peak increments in post-prandial blood glucose concentrations when compared to glucose, but not to sucrose. Similar results were obtained in healthy and type 2 diabetic subjects for the mean incremental area under the curve. No significant differences between carbohydrate sources were observed with respect to post-prandial insulin responses. The Panel notes that in this study fructose replaced sucrose and glucose in solid foods. In another test meal study by Crapo et al. (1980), 9 healthy subjects, 10 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, and 17 type 2 diabetic subjects received in a random order 50 g loads of glucose, sucrose and fructose, given alone in a drink or in combination with protein and fat, in a liquid formula meal. Diabetic subjects on oral hypoglycemic agents had discontinued medications two weeks before testing. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after each meal. Fructose consumption induced significantly lower blood glucose and insulin responses than sucrose or glucose consumption in all study groups, either when given alone or in the test meal, with the exception of post-prandial insulin responses, which in the diabetic group were flat and not significantly different for\n",

      "Supporting Evidence: Walsh et al. (1984) conducted an eight-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 20 obese subjects, who were randomly assigned to consume either glucomannan or placebo (starch) administered as 1 g doses (two capsules of 500 mg each) with 8 oz of water three times per day (before each meal) for eight weeks in the context of usual dietary patterns and levels of physical exercise. Body weight loss during the study was significantly higher in the glucomannan group (-5.5 ± 1.5 kg) than in the placebo group (1.5 ± 1.5 kg; difference between groups 7.0 ± 1.4 kg, p<0.005). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized intervention study (Cairella and Marchini, 1995), 30 overweight women (BMI=25-30 kg/m2) were treated for 60 days with a 1,200 kcal/d (5,040 kJ/d) diet plus either placebo (n=15) or glucomannan (n=15). A total of four capsules of glucomannan or placebo were given daily with 1-2 glasses of water 30-60 minutes prior to the two main meals (appr. 4 g per day). Body weight loss during the study was statistically significantly (p=0.0017) higher in the glucomannan group (-4.3 kg) than in the placebo group (-2.7 kg, mean difference 1.6 kg, 95%CI=0.7-2.5). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized intervention study (Birketvedt et al., 2005), healthy overweight subjects were randomly assigned to consume either glucomannan (n=23) or placebo (n=29) for five weeks in the context of an energy-reduced diet providing 1,200 kcal per day. Glucomannan (1.24 g per day) and placebo were administered in tablets (n=6) with 250 mL of water 15 minutes before each meal (three times daily) and at 3 pm (n=4 tablets). Weight loss during the intervention was significantly higher in the glucomannan group (-\n",

      "Supporting Evidence: Three human intervention studies, which addressed outcomes related to the claimed effect (Hall et al., 1981; Jain et al., 1986a; 1986b), were cited. In these studies, capsules of activated charcoal were used (194 mg or 260 mg/capsule). In a double-blind randomised trial (Jain et al., 1986a) in two healthy population groups in the United States (n=30; 20 males, 10 females) and India (n=69; 62 males, 7 females) in which lactulose was used as the substrate for fermentation, breath hydrogen levels were measured (at 30 min intervals for 4 h 30 min) to quantify the amount of gas produced in the colon. Each subject was tested with identical capsules of a non-carbohydrate (gelatine) placebo or activated charcoal (260 mg/capsule) on two days. Subjects fasted (except for water ad libitum) for 10 hours before being tested, and abstained from smoking for two hours before and during the test. After collecting the first (fasting) breath sample, four coded capsules were given to each subject and the same dose repeated one hour later. Lactulose (15 mL) was given half an hour after the first dose of capsules. Symptoms of bloating, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea experienced by the volunteers during and for four hours after collection of the last breath sample were recorded. The study was repeated one week later with the second set of coded capsules; those who received placebo the first time were given activated charcoal subsequently. Non-lactulose fermenting subjects (i.e. in whom lactulose ingestion did not produce a rise in breath hydrogen) were excluded from data analysis (remaining sample: 28 in the United States and 62 in India). In comparison to a placebo, activated charcoal significantly (p<0.05) reduced breath hydrogen in both population groups. In relation to subjective outcome measures, the Panel notes that no evidence was provided that the questionnaire used to score bloating and abdominal cramps was validated. In a double-blind, randomised study by Jain et al. (1986b) ten healthy adults (mean age: 28.3 years; 7 men, 3 women) were tested with identical-looking capsules of a non\n",
