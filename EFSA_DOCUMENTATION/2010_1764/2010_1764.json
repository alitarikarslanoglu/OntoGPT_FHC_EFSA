    "scientific_substantiation": " (ID 326) \nAccording to generally accepted scientific knowledge, chloride is an essential part of the human diet \nand is a part of most body fluids including blood, sweat, and tears. The amount of chloride in the body \nis controlled by the kidneys. The normal blood reference range of chloride for adults is 95 to 105 \n                                                     \n \n \n4 Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and \nhealth claims made on foods. OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9\u201325.  \n5 Briefing document for stakeholders on the evaluation of Article 13.1, 13.5 and 14 health claims: \nmmol per litre. There is usually no chloride deficiency in the human diet, and in Europe the intake \ntends to be higher than required (Elmadfa and Freisling, 2009). \nSix references cited include general reviews and handbook chapters (Bedanier, 2002; Garrow et al., \n2000; Gibney et al., 2002; Mann and Truswell, 2002) and two technical reports (EVM, 2002; JHCI, \n2003). It is well established that the chloride anion is an essential component of gastric juice acting as \ndissociated hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Chloride aids digestion by providing chloride for \nhydrochloric acid, an essential component of human digestive fluid. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of chloride as Na-, K-, Ca- or Mg-salt and contribution to normal digestion by production of \nhydrochloric acid in the stomach. However, the evidence provided does not establish that inadequate \nintake of chloride as Na-, K-, Ca- or Mg-salt leading to impaired digestion occurs in the general EU \npopulation. \n4. \n",
    "conditions_restrictions": " (ID 326) \nThe Panel considers that in order to bear the claim a food should be at least a source of chloride as per \nAnnex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a balanced \ndiet. The target population is the general population. \nTolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) have not been established for chloride due to insufficient data \n(EFSA, 2005).  \n",
    "conclusions": "  \nOn the basis of the data presented, the Panel concludes that: \uf0b7\n \nThe food constituent, chloride as Na-, K-, Ca- or Mg-salt, which is the subject of the health \nclaim, is sufficiently characterised. \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cstomach acid and digestion\u201d. The target population is assumed to be \nthe general population. Contribution to normal digestion by production of hydrochloric acid \nin the stomach is a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of chloride as \nNa-, K-, Ca- or Mg-salt and contribution to normal digestion by production of hydrochloric \nacid in the stomach.  \uf0b7\n \nThe evidence provided does not establish that inadequate intake of chloride as Na-, K-, Ca- or \nMg-salt leading to impaired digestion occurs in the general EU population. \uf0b7\n \nThe following wording reflects the scientific evidence: \u201cChloride, as Na-, K-, Ca- or Mg-salt, \ncontributes to normal digestion by production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach\u201d. \uf0b7\n \nIn order to bear the claim a food should be at least a source of chloride as per Annex to \nRegulation (EC) No 1924/2006.
