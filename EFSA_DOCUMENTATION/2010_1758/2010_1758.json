    "scientific_substantiation": " \nPantothenic acid is required for the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor and acyl group carrier \nfor many enzymatic processes and for the synthesis of the prosthetic group of the acyl carrier protein \n(ACP), a component of the fatty acid synthesis complex. Most tissues transport pantothenic acid into \ncells for the synthesis of CoA (IoM, 1998). The evidence for the essentiality of pantothenic acid \nconsists of its well known role in cellular biochemistry. \nDeficiency symptoms have only been observed in experimental settings such as giving a pantothenic \nacid metabolic antagonist and not in dietary studies. Deficiency symptoms included irritability, \nrestlessness, fatigue, apathy, malaise, sleep disturbances, numbness and muscle cramps (IoM, 1998). \n3.1. \nReduction of tiredness and fatigue (ID 63) \nDeficiency symptoms of pantothenic acid in experimental settings include fatigue (IoM, 1998). \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of pantothenic acid and reduction of tiredness and fatigue. However, the evidence provided \ndoes not establish that inadequate intake of pantothenic acid leading to tiredness and fatigue occurs in \nthe general EU population. \n4. \n",

    "conclusions": " \nOn the basis of the data available, the Panel concludes that: \uf0b7\n \nThe food constituent, pantothenic acid, which is the subject of the health claims is \nsufficiently characterised. \nMental performance (ID 58) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cthe role of vitamins and minerals in mental performance (where \nmental performance stands for those aspects of brain and nerve functions which determine \naspects like concentration, learning, memory and reasoning)\u201d. The target population is \nassumed to be the general population.  \uf0b7\n \nA claim on pantothenic acid and normal mental performance has already been assessed with \na favourable outcome. \nReduction of tiredness and fatigue (ID 63) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cvitamin/mineral supplementation to reduce fatigue and tiredness in \nsituations of inadequate micronutrient status\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the \ngeneral population. Reduction of tiredness and fatigue is a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of \npantothenic acid and reduction of tiredness and fatigue. \uf0b7\n \nThe evidence provided does not establish that inadequate intake of pantothenic acid leading \nto tiredness and fatigue occurs in the general EU population. \uf0b7\n \nThe following wording reflects the scientific evidence: \u201cPantothenic acid can contribute to \nthe reduction of tiredness and fatigue\u201d. \nAdrenal function (ID 204) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cadrenal function\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the general \npopulation. The claimed effect is not sufficiently defined, no clarifications were provided by \nMember States and no further details were contained in the proposed wording which could \nbe used to define the claimed effect. \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is general and non-specific and does not refer to any specific health claim \nas required by Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. \nMaintenance of normal skin (ID 2878) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cskin care\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the general \npopulation.  \uf0b7\n \nA claim on pantothenic acid and maintenance of normal skin has already been assessed with \nan unfavourable outcome and the references cited for this claim did not provide any \nadditional scientific data that could be used to substantiate the claim. \nConditions and possible restrictions of use  \uf0b7\n \nIn order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of pantothenic acid as per \nAnnex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a \nbalanced diet. The target population is the general population. \n",
