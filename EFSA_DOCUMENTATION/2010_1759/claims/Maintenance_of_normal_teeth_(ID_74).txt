Scientific Substantiation:
A total of 16 references were provided, including six textbooks, two opinions of scientific bodies, one review, five human studies and two other publications, on outcomes unrelated to the claimed effect. The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from these references for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect. The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary intake of vitamin B6 and maintenance of normal teeth.

Conditions and Restrictions:
 
The Panel considers that in order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of vitamin B6 as 
per Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a 
balanced diet. The target population is the general population. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) 
have been established for vitamin B6 in children, adolescents and adults (SCF, 2000). 


Conclusions:
The claimed effect is “bone/teeth/hair/skin and nail health”. The target population is assumed to be the general population. Maintenance of normal teeth is a beneficial physiological effect. 
A cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary intake of 
vitamin B6 and maintenance of normal teeth.
