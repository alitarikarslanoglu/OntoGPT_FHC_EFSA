Scientific Substantiation:
The transsulphuration pathway is an alternative metabolic route to remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The pathway utilises the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase, and catabolises homocysteine through condensation with serine to cystathionine, followed by cleavage of that molecule to produce cysteine and α-ketobutyrate (Mackey et al., 2006). Under conditions of maximal metabolic efficiency, plasma concentration of homocysteine ranges from 4 to 10 µmol/L. Metabolic blocks in homocysteine metabolism lead to accumulation of intra-cellular homocysteine with subsequent export into the blood. Depending on the magnitude of the metabolic impairment, plasma homocysteine can rise to varying degrees. Hyperhomocysteinemia is also caused by B vitamin deficiencies. Deficiencies of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 lead to impaired homocysteine metabolism causing mild, moderate, or severe elevations in plasma homocysteine, depending on the severity of the deficiency, as well as the coexistence of genetic or other factors that interfere with homocysteine metabolism (Miller, 2005). The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin B6 and contribution to normal homocysteine metabolism.

Conditions and Restrictions:
 
The Panel considers that in order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of vitamin B6 as 
per Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a 
balanced diet. The target population is the general population. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) 
have been established for vitamin B6 in children, adolescents and adults (SCF, 2000). 


Conclusions:
The claimed effects are “homocysteine levels”, “homocysteine metabolism” and “heart health”. The target population is assumed to be the general population. Contribution to normal homocysteine metabolism is a beneficial physiological effect.  A cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin B6 and contribution to normal homocysteine metabolism.  The following wording reflects the scientific evidence: “Vitamin B6 contributes to normal homocysteine metabolism”.
