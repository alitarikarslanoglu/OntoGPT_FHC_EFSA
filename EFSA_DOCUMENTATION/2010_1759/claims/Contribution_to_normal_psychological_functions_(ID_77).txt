Scientific Substantiation:
One of the classical symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency is confusion (IoM, 2000), implying impairment of normal psychological functions. The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin B6 and contribution to normal psychological functions.

Conditions and Restrictions:
 
The Panel considers that in order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of vitamin B6 as 
per Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a 
balanced diet. The target population is the general population. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) 
have been established for vitamin B6 in children, adolescents and adults (SCF, 2000). 


Conclusions:
The claimed effect is “The role of vitamins and minerals in mental performance (where 
mental performance stands for those aspects of brain and nerve functions which determine 
aspects like concentration, learning, memory and reasoning)”. The target population is 
assumed to be the general population. Contribution to normal psychological functions, 
which encompass cognitive and affective domains, is a beneficial physiological effect. 
A cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of vitamin 
B6 and contribution to normal psychological functions. 
The following wording reflects the scientific evidence: “Vitamin B6 contributes to normal 
psychological functions”.
