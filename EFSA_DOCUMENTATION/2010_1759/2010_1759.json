    "scientific_substantiation": " \nVitamin B6 functions as a coenzyme in a variety of enzymatic reactions in the metabolism of amino \nacids, one-carbon units, lipids, the pathways of gluconeogenesis, haem, and neurotransmitter \nbiosynthesis (McCormick, 2006; Mackey et al., 2006). \n3.1. \nContribution to normal homocysteine metabolism (ID 73, 76, 199) \nThe transsulphuration pathway is an alternative metabolic route to remethylation of homocysteine to \nmethionine. The pathway utilises the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, cystathionine \n\u03b2-synthase and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase, and catabolises homocysteine through condensation with serine \nto cystathionine, followed by cleavage of that molecule to produce cysteine and \u03b1-ketobutyrate \n(Mackey et al., 2006). \nUnder conditions of maximal metabolic efficiency, plasma concentration of homocysteine ranges \nfrom 4 to 10 \u00b5mol/L. Metabolic blocks in homocysteine metabolism lead to accumulation of intra-\ncellular homocysteine with subsequent export into the blood. Depending on the magnitude of the \nmetabolic impairment, plasma homocysteine can rise to varying degrees. Hyperhomocysteinemia is \nalso caused by B vitamin deficiencies. Deficiencies of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 lead to \nimpaired homocysteine metabolism causing mild, moderate, or severe elevations in plasma \nhomocysteine, depending on the severity of the deficiency, as well as the coexistence of genetic or \nother factors that interfere with homocysteine metabolism (Miller, 2005). \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and contribution to normal homocysteine metabolism. \n3.2. \nMaintenance of normal bone (ID 74) \nA total of 16 references were provided, including six textbooks, two opinions of scientific bodies, one \nreview, five human studies and two other publications. Most of the studies dealt with the role of \nhomocysteine as a putative risk factor for osteoporosis. The Panel considers that no conclusions can \nbe drawn from these references for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and maintenance of normal bone. \n3.3. \nMaintenance of normal teeth (ID 74) \nA total of 16 references were provided, including six textbooks, two opinions of scientific bodies, one \nreview, five human studies and two other publications, on outcomes unrelated to the claimed effect. \nThe Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from these references for the scientific \nsubstantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and maintenance of normal teeth. \n3.4. \nMaintenance of normal hair (ID 74) \nA total of 16 references were provided, including six textbooks, two opinions of scientific bodies, one \nreview, five human studies and two other publications, on outcomes unrelated to the claimed effect. \nThe Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from these references for the scientific \nsubstantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and maintenance of normal hair. \n3.5. \nMaintenance of normal skin (ID 74) \nA total of 16 references were provided, including six textbooks, two opinions of scientific bodies, one \nreview, five human studies and two other publications. The only reference related to vitamin B6 and \nskin was a link to a website advising adolescents on their intake of nutrients. The Panel considers that \nno conclusions can be drawn from these references for the scientific substantiation of the claimed \neffect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and maintenance of normal skin. \n3.6. \nMaintenance of normal nails (ID 74) \nA total of 16 references were provided, including six textbooks, two opinions of scientific bodies, one \nreview, five human studies and two other publications, on outcomes unrelated to the claimed effect. \nThe Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from these references for the scientific \nsubstantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and maintenance of normal nails. \n3.7. \nContribution to normal energy-yielding metabolism (ID 75, 214) \nVitamin B6, as PLP, plays a dual role in the provision of glucose. Glycogen phosphorylase relies on \nPLP as a coenzyme in the enzymatic cleavage of glycogen that sequentially releases glucose-1-\nphosphate units. PLP-dependent transaminases convert gluconeogenic amino acids to alpha-keto acids \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and contribution to normal energy-yielding metabolism. \n3.8. \nContribution to normal psychological functions (ID 77) \nOne of the classical symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency is confusion (IoM, 2000), implying \nimpairment of normal psychological functions. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and contribution to normal psychological functions. \n3.9. \nReduction of tiredness and fatigue (ID 78) \nChronic vitamin B6 deficiency can cause microcytic, hypochromic anaemia in which the haemoglobin \nconcentration of erythrocytes is reduced (Mackey et al., 2006), which may lead to symptoms of \nweakness, tiredness or fatigue. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and a reduction of tiredness and fatigue. \n3.10. \nContribution to normal cysteine synthesis (ID 4283) \nThe SH group in cysteine derives from methionine whilst the carbon skeleton comes from serine. \nBoth the synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine and the splitting of cystathionine to \nrelease cysteine are catalysed by PLP dependent enzymes. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of vitamin B6 and contribution to normal cysteine synthesis. \n4. \n",
