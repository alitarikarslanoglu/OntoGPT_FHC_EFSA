    "scientific_substantiation": " (ID 1143, 2976) \nForty-three references were cited to substantiate the claim. Among these references, the non-pertinent \nreferences included review articles and text books, or were related to yoghurt and gut functions in \ngeneral, survival of lactic acid bacteria in the human stomach, \u201cprobiotics\u201d and \u201cprebiotics\u201d in \npromotion of lactose digestion, production of \u03b2-galactosidase by Streptococcus thermophilus, the \neffect of Lactobacillus acidophilus on lactose maldigestion and survival of starter cultures and lactase \nin heated and frozen yoghurts. The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from these \nreferences for the scientific substantiation of the claim. \nThe following 14 human intervention studies were considered pertinent to the claim (Kolars et al., \n1984; Savaiano et al., 1984; Dewit et al., 1988; Lerebours et al., 1989; Onwulata et al., 1989; Pochart \net al., 1989; Marteau et al., 1990; Martini et al., 1991; Rosado et al., 1992; Varela-Moreiras et al., \n1992; Shermak et al., 1995; Rizkalla et al., 2000; Labayen et al., 2001; Pelletier et al., 2001).  \n                                                     \n \n \n8 Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health \nclaims made on foods. OJ L 404, 30.12.2006, p. 9\u201325.  \n9\nMany studies have compared the effect of consumption of fresh yoghurt with live cultures to \npasteurised yoghurt with reduced or no live cultures on intestinal lactose utilisation in lactose \nmaldigesters (Savaiano et al., 1984; Dewit et al., 1988; Lerebours et al., 1989; Pochart et al., 1989; \nVarela-Moreiras et al., 1992; Shermak et al., 1995; Rizkalla et al., 2000; Labayen et al., 2001; Pelletier \net al., 2001). Also, in some studies pasteurised milk (Kolars et al., 1984; Marteau et al., 1990), milk \ninoculated with Lactobacillus acidophilus (Onwulata et al., 1989), lactose-hydrolysed milk (Onwulata \net al., 1989; Rosado et al., 1992) and lactase tablets (Onwulata et al., 1989) were compared with \nyoghurt (fresh or heated) in order to investigate the effect on lactose digestion. \nIn most pertinent studies, the breath hydrogen concentration (BHC) method has been applied to \nmeasure lactose digestion. This method is based on the measurement of the concentration of hydrogen \nreleased into the breath from lactose hydrolysed after ingestion of a certain amount of lactose (usually \n18 grams or higher). The method is not specific but is generally applied in clinical practice for the \ndiagnosis of lactose maldigestion. \nIn most studies, lactose digestion has been investigated upon a single dose of the test product (Kolars \net al., 1984; Savaiano et al., 1984; Dewit et al., 1988; Lerebours et al., 1989; Martini et al., 1991; \nRosado et al., 1992; Varela-Moreiras et al., 1992; Shermak et al., 1995; Onwulata et al., 1989; \nPelletier et al., 2001) whereas in a few studies lactose digestion was studied after prolonged ingestion \nof fresh or heat-treated yoghurt (Lerebours et al., 1989; Marteau et al., 1990; Rizkalla et al., 2000; \nLabayen et al., 2001).  \nAll of the 14 studies mentioned above were performed using the yoghurt cultures Lactobacillus \ndelbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus). \nDewit et al. (1988) investigated breath hydrogen concentration (BHC) after ingestion of lactose in \nwater, milk, fresh or heated yoghurt by 26 healthy, young adults with or without lactose maldigestion. \nThe fresh yoghurt contained 3 x 108 CFU/g S. thermophilus and 3 x 108 CFU/g L. bulgaricus. The \ntotal amount of lactose ingested with each product was 18 g. Ingestion of fresh yoghurt reduced BHC \nsignificantly (p<0.001) compared to lactose or milk, whereas after ingestion of heated yoghurt BHC \nwas higher (p<0.01) compared to fresh yoghurt. \nThe double-blind study by Lerebours et al. (1989) evaluated lactose digestion (using BHC) after \nshort-term (24 h) or prolonged (8 day) ingestion of yoghurt and fermented-then-pasteurised milk \n(FPM) by 16 lactase-deficient subjects. Consumption of yoghurt (125 g three times per day) enhanced \nlactose digestion (18 g lactose in yoghurt) and this effect was destroyed by pasteurisation. Similar \nresults were obtained in both study periods and no adaptation of lactase activity was observed in long-\nterm ingestion of yoghurt. \nMarteau et al. (1990) measured BHC in eight lactase-deficient volunteers who ingested 18 g of lactose \nin the form of milk (400 mL whole milk per day), yoghurt (450 g per day) and heated yoghurt (450 g \nper day) for three consecutive days. Total BHC was significantly lower after consumption of yoghurt \nand heated yoghurt compared with milk consumption (p<0.001). Significantly less lactose was \nrecovered from the terminal ileum after yoghurt than after heated yoghurt meals (p<0.05), and \napproximately one-fifth of the lactase activity contained in yoghurt reached the terminal ileum.  \nVarela-Moreiras et al. (1992) evaluated lactose maldigestion after ingestion of three dairy products by \n53 healthy institutionalised elderly people; 36 % of them were found to be lactose maldigesters using \nthe BHC test. The effect of consuming an equivalent amount of lactose (11 g lactose in 200 mL of \nproduct) contained in yoghurt and fermented-then-pasteurised milk (FPM) was assessed in these \nsubjects. BHC was significantly higher after ingestion of milk than after ingestion of yoghurt (p<0.05). \nThis effect was partially eliminated when FPM was tested. Moreover, BHC was significantly higher \nthree hours after ingestion of FPM compared to normal yoghurt (p< 0.05).  \nIn the study of Rizkalla et al. (2000), two groups of 12 healthy men with or without lactose \nassigned in a cross-over design to 500 g per day of either fresh or heat-treated yoghurt for two periods \nof 15 days each, separated by a 15 days washout interval. In subjects with lactose maldigestion, BHC \nvalues were significantly lower after consumption of fresh compared to heat-treated yoghurt \nconsumption (p<0.01).  \nIn the double-blind, cross-over designed study of Labayen et al. (2001), 22 lactose maldigesters \nreceived daily 25 g of lactose in fresh yoghurt (live yoghurt bacteria >108 CFU/g) or heat-treated \nyoghurt (<102 CFU/g) for 15 days, followed by a cross-over (15 days) after a wash-out period \n(14 days). The test dose was 500 mL per day for both products. The BHC test indicated more effective \nlactose digestion after fresh yoghurt intake as compared to heat-treated yoghurt. The orocaecal transit \ntime (OCTT) was shorter after heated yoghurt ingestion as compared with fresh yoghurt and there \nwere less severe gastrointestinal symptoms (p< 0.05) after fresh yoghurt intake.  \nPelletier et al. (2001) assessed in a double-blind, randomised cross-over study the effects of ingestion \nof milk, yoghurt (108 CFU/mL), heat-treated (70 \u00b0C, 30 sec) yoghurt (<15 CFU/mL) and two products \nobtained by dilution of yoghurt with heat-treated product (106 and 105 CFU/mL) on hydrogen \nproduction and symptoms of lactose intolerance in 24 male lactose maldigesters. Hydrogen production \nand adverse events were followed during eight hours after ingestion of a single dose of each test \nproduct. The volume of each serving was not indicated. At each test, subjects received 25 g lactose in \none of the products. Ingestion of yoghurt with 108 CFU/mL led to significantly lower BHC values \n(p<0,001 for AUCi (incremental area under curve, p=0.036 for Cmax maximal hydrogen \nconcentration variation)) and a reduced number of complaints compared to the other products.  \nKolars et al. (1984) used the BHC test to determine in 10 lactose-intolerant subjects (20 to 28 years of \nage) whether lactase-deficient subjects digested lactose better in yoghurt than in milk. Breath samples \nwere obtained in the fasting state and hourly for eight hours after ingestion of the following test meals: \nlactulose (10 g in 200 mL of water), lactose (20 g in 400 mL of water), milk (400 mL containing 18 g \nof lactose) and commercial unflavoured yoghurt (440 g containing 18 g of lactose, and 270 g \ncontaining 11 g of lactose, respectively). Ingestion of 440 g of test yoghurt resulted in only about one \nthird as much hydrogen excretion as a similar load of lactose in milk or water. This difference was \nstatistically significant (p<0.01). In case of lactulose, the increase in breath hydrogen was comparable \nto that obtained with lactose. The symptoms reported by the subjects after ingestion of test meals \nsupported the perception that lactose was digested better in yoghurt than in milk; 80 per cent of the \nsubjects ingesting milk versus 20 per cent of those ingesting yoghurt reported diarrhoea or flatulence. \nOnwulata et al. (1989) evaluated lactose digestion after intake of commercial plain yoghurt, sweet \nacidophilus milk, hydrolysed-lactose milk, a lactase tablet, and whole milk by 10 lactose-intolerant \nsubjects. In a 5 x 5 Latin square design, BHC was measured for five hours after the subjects had \nconsumed one of the products (totally 18 g lactose in each except lactose-hydrolysed milk, which \nprovided 5 g). The products were consumed in a single dose (volume was not indicated) in five \nperiods at five weekly intervals. Mean BHC values (ppm) were significantly (p<0.05) lower for \nyoghurt than for sweet acidophilus milk and whole milk. With regard to alleviating symptoms of \nlactose maldigestion, yoghurt was as effective as lactose-hydrolysed milk, but was significantly \n(p<0.05) more effective than commercial lactase consumed along with milk.  \nShermak et al. (1995) compared symptoms of lactose maldigestion and breath hydrogen production \nafter typical servings of milk, heat-treated yoghurt (85 \u00b0C, 30 min), and yoghurt containing live \nbacteria ingested by 14 lactose-maldigesting children (mean age 9.5 years). Symptoms and BHC \nvalues were recorded for eight hours after ingestion of 12 g lactose served in milk and yoghurts. Live \nyoghurt contained 1.6 x 108 CFU/g of both yoghurt cultures and the pasteurised yoghurt contained \n2.5 x 103 CFU/g of both cultures. Lactose-maldigesting children experienced significantly fewer \nsymptoms after consuming yoghurt with live cultures than after intake of milk (p<0.005). Pasteurised \nyoghurt showed an intermediate effect. Lactose from yoghurt was not better digested than lactose from \nmilk, as indicated by similar areas under the hydrogen curve in the BHC test. However, yoghurt was \nassociated with a delayed time to rise and lower rate of rise of the hydrogen concentration in the \nbreath. \nRosado et al. (1992) compared the efficiency of lactose digestion after consumption of two \nunmodified plain yoghurts, a low-fat yoghurt and a yoghurt produced from lactose-hydrolysed milk by \nassessing BHC in 14 lactose-maldigesters. Compared to whole milk, the hydrogen breath response to \ntwo varieties of unmodified yoghurt and the lactose-hydrolysed yoghurt was significantly (p<0.05) \nattenuated while the hydrogen response to low-fat yoghurt was intermediate. Intolerance symptoms \nwere significantly (p<0.05) and equally reduced (50 %, p<0.05) with all four yoghurt products \ncompared to whole milk.  \nThe results from human studies carried out by Savaiano et al. (1984), Pochart et al. (1989) and Martini \net al. (1991) are consistent with those from the above studies and can be considered as supportive \nalthough the number of subjects enrolled in those studies was relatively small (less than 12 per study).   \nIn addition, Drouault et al. (2002) applied a bacterial luciferase to monitor gene expression of \nStreptococcus thermophilus in the digestive tract of germ-free mice. The main result was that the \nbacterium was able to produce active \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme in the digestive tract, although the \nbacterium did not multiply during gastrointestinal transit. The enzyme production was enhanced when \nlactose (the inducer) was added to the diet.  \nIn weighing the evidence, the Panel took into consideration that thirteen of fourteen human studies \nshowed enhanced digestion of lactose in yoghurt in lactose maldigesters, when live yoghurt starter \ncultures were ingested in yoghurt, that the one study which did not show such an effect reported \nreduced symptoms and that there was strong evidence for the biological plausibility of the effect.10  \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the \nconsumption of live yoghurt cultures in yoghurt and improved digestion of lactose in yoghurt in \nindividuals with lactose maldigestion.11   \n4. \n",
