    "scientific_substantiation": " \n3.1. \nMaintenance of normal cardiac function (ID 504, 506, 516, 527, 538, 703, 1128, 1317, \n1324, 1325) \nNational and international bodies have based their recommendations for dietary intake of EPA and \nDHA on the inverse relationship observed between the consumption of these long-chain n-3 PUFAs \n(primarily from fish and fish oils) and a lower risk of coronary artery disease. Such recommendations \nrange from 200 mg to 500 mg per day (EFSA, 2005, 2009; EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, \nNutrition and Allergies (NDA), 2010). Most recent evidence derived from meta-analyses of \nrandomised trials and large prospective studies shows that, when only healthy subjects are considered, \nthe intake of EPA plus DHA is negatively related to coronary heart disease mortality in a dose-\ndependent way up to about 250 mg per day (1\u20132 servings of oily fish per week), with little additional \nbenefit observed at higher intakes (Mozaffarian and Rimm, 2006; Mozaffarian, 2008; Harris et al., \n2008, 2009a, b; EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA), 2010). \nEPA and DHA intakes could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease mortality by different (but often \noverlapping) mechanisms (e.g. through antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects, by reducing blood \npressure, heart rate and plasma concentrations of triglycerides), and the doses of EPA and DHA \n(100->2,500 mg/d) as well as the time required to observe clinical effects and/or alter clinical events \n(weeks to years) through each mechanism may vary widely (Mozaffarian and Rimm, 2006). \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the \nconsumption of EPA and DHA and maintenance of normal cardiac function. \n3.2. \nMaintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations (ID 566) \nThree references were provided for the scientific substantiation of this claim. One was a narrative \nreview on n-3 fatty acids and the metabolic syndrome, one reported on an intervention study on the \neffects of a hypocaloric low-fat dietary intervention limiting intake of fatty fish and fish oil \nsupplements on membrane fatty acid composition and insulin sensitivity, and the third reference \nreported on an intervention study investigating the acute effects of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated \nfatty acids on dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance in healthy human volunteers. No measures of \nblood glucose control were reported in any of these studies. The Panel considers that no conclusions \ncan be drawn from these references for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the \nconsumption of EPA and DHA and long-term maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations. \n3.3. \nMaintenance of normal (fasting) blood concentrations of triglycerides (ID 506, 527, \n538, 1317, 1324, 1325) \nA claim on EPA and DHA and the maintenance of normal (fasting) blood concentrations of \ntriglycerides has been already assessed with a favourable outcome (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, \nNutrition and Allergies (NDA), 2009). The Panel considered that intakes of EPA and DHA of about \n2-4 g per day were required to obtain the claimed effect.  \nThe Panel is aware of a recently published meta-analysis which aimed to investigate dose-response \nrelationships between the intake of EPA and DHA and changes in blood concentrations of \ntriglycerides to estimate the effects of doses between 200-500 mg per day (Musa-Veloso et al., 2010). \nA total of 15 studies published between 2002 and 2007 were considered. The reason given to exclude \npublications prior to 2002 was \u201cto avoid duplication of previously reported findings\u201d. Of these, only \n12 studies conducted statistical comparisons between intervention and placebo groups. Average \nintakes of EPA and DHA were 2.3 g per day (range 209 mg to 5.6 g per day). The Panel notes that \nfour studies were conducted with DHA only (Maki et al., 2003, 2005; Stark and Holub, 2004; Wu et \nal., 2006). The Panel also notes that only two studies were included using doses of DHA or EPA plus \nDHA in the range for which an effect on blood triglycerides was aimed for, that neither of these found \na significant decrease in blood triglycerides in the intervention group compared to controls (Maki et \nal., 2003; Castro et al., 2007), and that one of them is considered as \u201cflawed\u201d by the authors of the \nmeta-analysis (Castro et al., 2007). The Panel notes that exclusion of pertinent studies published \nbefore 2002 is scientifically unjustified. The Panel considers that no scientific conclusions can be \ndrawn from this meta-analysis to establish conditions of use for the claim. \nIn addition to Maki et al. (2003) and Castro et al. (2007), only one study included in the meta-analysis \nused doses of EPA plus DHA <1 g per day (0.860 mg per day). In this study, additional intakes in the \nintervention and placebo groups of about 1,200 mg per day from dietary sources were estimated but \nand DHA at doses of 1 and 1.6 g per day were included in the meta-analysis (Goyens and Mensink, \n2006; Murphy et al., 2007), none of these reported statistically significant differences between the \nintervention and control groups with respect to changes in blood concentrations of triglycerides. \nWith reference to its previous opinion, the Panel considers that intakes of EPA and DHA of 2 g per \nday are required to obtain the claimed effect. \n3.4. \nProtection of the skin from photo-oxidative (UV-induced) damage (ID 530) \nAmong the 26 references provided for the scientific substantiation of this claim, most reported on \nfood constituents (e.g. vitamin E) and/or health effects (e.g. coronary heart disease, sudden cardiac \ndeath, blood lipids, blood glucose control, infertility, pregnancy, inflammation, psoriasis, non-\nmelanoma skin cancer) unrelated to the claimed effect. The Panel considers that no conclusions can \nbe drawn from these references for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect. \nTwo of the references are general reviews on the role of n-3 fatty acids on the pathogenesis of skin \ncancer (Black and Rhodes, 2006) and photo-protection (Rhodes, 1998) but did not provide original \ndata for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect. \nAn open label intervention study in humans on the effects of fish oil supplementation on the minimal \nerythemal dose of UVB irradiation, and on the threshold UVB irradiation dose for papule provocation \nin patients with polymorphic light eruption, was presented (Rhodes et al., 1995). The Panel notes that \nno conclusions can be drawn from this uncontrolled study for the scientific substantiation of the \nclaimed effect. \nA double-blind, placebo controlled intervention study was presented on the effects of EPA alone (4 g \nper day) on a range of indicators of ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced responses and damage in \nhumans, as well as on basal and post-UVR oxidative status (Rhodes et al., 2003). The Panel considers \nthat no conclusions can be drawn from this study on EPA alone for the scientific substantiation of a \nclaim on the combination of EPA and DHA.  \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the \nconsumption of EPA and DHA and the protection of the skin from photo-oxidative (UV-induced) \ndamage. \n4. \n",
