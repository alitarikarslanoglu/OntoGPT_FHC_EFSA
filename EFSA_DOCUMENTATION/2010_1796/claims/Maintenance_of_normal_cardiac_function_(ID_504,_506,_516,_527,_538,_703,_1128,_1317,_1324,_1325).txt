Scientific Substantiation:
National and international bodies have based their recommendations for dietary intake of EPA and DHA on the inverse relationship observed between the consumption of these long-chain n-3 PUFAs (primarily from fish and fish oils) and a lower risk of coronary artery disease. Such recommendations range from 200 mg to 500 mg per day (EFSA, 2005, 2009; EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA), 2010). Most recent evidence derived from meta-analyses of randomised trials and large prospective studies shows that, when only healthy subjects are considered, the intake of EPA plus DHA is negatively related to coronary heart disease mortality in a dose-dependent way up to about 250 mg per day (1–2 servings of oily fish per week), with little additional benefit observed at higher intakes (Mozaffarian and Rimm, 2006; Mozaffarian, 2008; Harris et al., 2008, 2009a, b; EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA), 2010). EPA and DHA intakes could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease mortality by different (but often overlapping) mechanisms (e.g. through antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic effects, by reducing blood pressure, heart rate and plasma concentrations of triglycerides), and the doses of EPA and DHA (100->2,500 mg/d) as well as the time required to observe clinical effects and/or alter clinical events (weeks to years) through each mechanism may vary widely (Mozaffarian and Rimm, 2006). The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the consumption of EPA and DHA and maintenance of normal cardiac function.

Conditions and Restrictions:
 
5.1. 
Maintenance of normal cardiac function (ID 504, 506, 516, 527, 538, 703, 1128, 1317, 
1324, 1325) 
The Panel considers that intakes of EPA and DHA of about 250 mg per day are required to obtain the 
claimed effect. Such an amount can be consumed as part of a balanced diet. The target population is 
the general population. 
5.2. 
Maintenance of normal (fasting) blood concentrations of triglycerides (ID 506, 527, 
538, 1317, 1324, 1325) 
The Panel considers that intakes of EPA and DHA of 2 g per day are required to obtain the claimed 
effect. Such an amount can be consumed as part of a balanced diet. The target population is adult men 
and women. 


Conclusions:
The claimed effects are “cardiovascular system: maintenance and promotion of heart health and healthy circulation”, “normal cardiovascular function”, “eye, brain and heart health”, “cardiovascular health” and “heart health”. The target population is assumed to be the general population. Maintenance of normal cardiac function is a beneficial physiological effect. A cause and effect relationship has been established between the consumption of EPA and DHA and maintenance of normal cardiac function. The following wording reflects the scientific evidence: “EPA and DHA contribute to the normal function of the heart”. Intakes of EPA and DHA of about 250 mg per day are required to obtain the claimed effect. Such an amount can be consumed as part of a balanced diet. The target population is the general population.
