Scientific Substantiation:
Insufficient intake of folate results in the deficiency condition of macrocytic anaemia. Symptoms of weakness and fatigue typically appear at an advanced stage of anaemia or at milder degrees of anaemia in some subjects (IoM, 1998). The Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of folate and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue.

Conditions and Restrictions:
  
The Panel considers that in order to bear the claims a food should be at least a source of folate as per 
Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. Such amounts can be easily consumed as part of a balanced 
diet. The target population is the general population. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) have been 
established for folic acid for children and adults (SCF, 2000). 


Conclusions:
The claimed effect is “vitamin/mineral supplementation to reduce fatigue and tiredness in situations of inadequate micronutrient status”. The target population is assumed to be the general population. Reduction of tiredness and fatigue is a beneficial physiological effect. A cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary intake of folate and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. The following wording reflects the scientific evidence: “Folate can contribute to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue”.
