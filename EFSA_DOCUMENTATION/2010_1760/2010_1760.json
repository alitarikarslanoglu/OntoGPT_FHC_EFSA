    "scientific_substantiation": " \nFolates play an important role in the transfer of C1-groups (i.e. methyl-, methylene- and formyl-\ngroups), maintaining the methylation balance (SCF, 2000). Folate coenzymes are involved in \nnumerous reactions that involve DNA synthesis, purine synthesis, generation of formate into the \nformate pool and amino acid interconversion (IoM, 1998).  \n \n3.1. \nContribution to normal psychological functions (ID 81, 85, 86, 88)  \nSevere folate deficiency in humans is characterised by macrocytic anaemia which produces symptoms \nof weakness, fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, irritability, headache, palpitations and shortness of \nbreath (IoM, 1998).  \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of folate and contribution to normal psychological functions. \n3.2. \nMaintenance of normal vision (ID 83, 87)  \nThirteen references were provided for the substantiation of the claimed effect, including four \nauthoritative body reports, two reviews, one meta-analysis, five human studies and one consensus \nreport.  \nOne reference provided regulatory provisions and most of the references addressed endpoints \nunrelated to the claimed effect, including pregnancy outcomes, prevention of neural tube defects, \nhuman reproduction and antioxidant activity. The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn \nfrom these references for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect. \nA meta-analysis of case-control studies in patients with retinal vascular occlusive disease (Cahill et \nal., 2003), a study by Kamburoglu et al. (2006) with patients diagnosed with age-related macular \ndegeneration and a longitudinal study in Pima Indians with Type 2 diabetes (Looker et al., 2003) were \nnot considered to be pertinent to the claimed effect because the Panel considers that the evidence \nprovided does not establish that patients with retinal vascular occlusive disease, patients with age-\nrelated macular degeneration or individuals with Type 2 diabetes are representative of the general \npopulation with regard to normal vision. \nThe study of Taylor et al. (2002) evaluated the odds for early age-related cortical and posterior \nsubcapsular lens opacities and long term intake of vitamins and carotenoids in 492 non-diabetic \nwomen aged 53\u201373 years and found that no nutrient intake measure was related to the prevalence of \nopacities in the total sample. Sub-group analyses, however, indicated that there was a significant \ncorrelation between folate intake and posterior subcapsular lens opacities in a subgroup of never-\nsmokers (P=0.02); the Panel notes that the association with folate intake might be explained by the \nhigh correlation (r=0.42) between folate and carotenoid intakes in their data-set and that diets high in \nfolate are also generally high in carotenoids. \nIn weighing the evidence, the Panel noted that the only human study presented was an \nepidemiological study which did not show any effect of long term intake of folate from foods or \nsupplement use on the primary vision outcome measures.  \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the dietary \nintake of folate and the maintenance of normal vision. \n3.3. \nReduction of tiredness and fatigue (ID 84) \nInsufficient intake of folate results in the deficiency condition of macrocytic anaemia. Symptoms of \nweakness and fatigue typically appear at an advanced stage of anaemia or at milder degrees of \nanaemia in some subjects (IoM, 1998). \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of folate and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. \n \n3.4. \nContribution to normal amino acid synthesis (ID 195, 2881) \nFolate coenzymes are involved in amino acid interconversions, including the catabolism of histidine \nto glutamic acid, interconversion of serine to glycine and remethylation of homocysteine to \nmethionine (IoM, 1998; FAO/WHO, 2002; Carmel, 2006). Folate-mediated transfer of single-carbon \nunits from serine provides a major source of substrate in single-carbon metabolism. The conversion of \nhomocysteine to methionine serves as a major source of methionine for the synthesis of S-adenosyl-\nmethionine, which participates as the methyl donor in many biological methylation reactions of \nproteins, nucleoproteins, histones, neurotransmitters and phospholipids (IoM, 1998; Carmel, 2006). \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the dietary \nintake of folate and contribution to normal amino acids synthesis. \n4. \n",
