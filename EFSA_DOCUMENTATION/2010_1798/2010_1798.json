    "scientific_substantiation": " \n3.1. \nReduction of body weight (ID 854, 1556, 3725) \nA total of 45 references were cited for the scientific substantiation of this claim. Among them, six \nreported on intervention studies in humans investigating the effects of glucomannan on body weight \n(Birketvedt et al., 2005; Cairella and Marchini, 1995; Vido et al., 1993; Vita et al., 1992; Vuksan et \nal., 1999; Walsh et al., 1984). Also, the Panel identified three additional references cited in relation to \nother claims on glucomannan as being pertinent to this claim (Wood et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2003; \nVuksan et al., 2001).  \nWalsh et al. (1984) conducted an eight-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial in \n20 obese subjects, who were randomly assigned to consume either glucomannan or placebo (starch) \nadministered as 1 g doses (two capsules of 500 mg each) with 8 oz of water three times per day \n(before each meal) for eight weeks in the context of usual dietary patterns and levels of physical \nexercise. Body weight loss during the study was significantly higher in the glucomannan group \n(-5.5\uf0b11.5 kg) than in the placebo group (1.5\uf0b11.5 kg; difference between groups 7.0\uf0b11.4 kg, p<0.005). \nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised intervention study (Cairella and Marchini, 1995), \n30 overweight women (BMI=25-30 kg/m2) were treated for 60 days with a 1,200 kcal/d (5,040 kJ/d) \ndiet plus either placebo (n=15) or glucomannan (n=15). A total of four capsules of glucomannan or \nplacebo were given daily with 1-2 glasses of water 30-60 minutes prior to the two main meals \n(appr. 4 g per day). Body weight loss during the study was statistically significantly (p=0.0017) higher \nin the glucomannan group (-4.3 kg) than in the placebo group (-2.7 kg, mean difference 1.6 kg, \n95%CI=0.7-2.5). \nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised intervention study (Birketvedt et al., 2005), healthy \noverweight subjects were randomly assigned to consume either glucomannan (n=23) or placebo \n(n=29) for five weeks in the context of an energy-reduced diet providing 1,200 kcal per day. \nGlucomannan (1.24 g per day) and placebo were administered in tablets (n=6) with 250 mL of water \n15 minutes before each meal (three times daily) and at 3 pm (n=4 tablets). Weight loss during the \nintervention was significantly higher in the glucomannan group (-3.8\uf0b10.9) than in the placebo group \n(-2.5\uf0b10.5, p<0.01).  \nIn the study by Vita et al. (1992), 50 obese subjects (15 males) were randomly assigned to consume a \nhypocaloric diet (1,000 kcal/d or 4,200 kJ/d for women and 1,300 kcal or 5,460 kJ/d for men) either \nalone (control, n=25, 8 males) or together with glucomannan supplements (2+3+3 capsules with \n300 mL water before meals, appr. 4 g per day in three doses) for three months. The authors reported a \ngreater weight loss in the glucomannan group compared to controls at the end of the study (p<0.02) \nexpressed as percentage of initial body weight from baseline. Mean changes are given as a histogram \n(approx. -25 % versus -20 % of initial body weight in the glucomannan and placebo groups \nrespectively) and SD are not reported.  \nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised intervention study (Vido et al., 1993), \n60 overweight children under the age of 15 (mean age 11.2 years) were randomised to consume \nglucomannan (two capsules with two glasses of water one hour prior to each meal, 2 g/d, n=30) or \nplacebo (n=30) for two months in the context of a normocaloric diet. The percentage of children being \noverweight significantly decreased during the study in both the intervention and the placebo groups \nwith no significant differences between groups. No differences between groups in body weight \nchanges were observed at the end of the study.  \nIn a cross-over randomised controlled trial (RTC), 11 non diabetic, mildly hypertensive, free-living \nsubjects with the insulin resistance syndrome (out of 278 subjects screened) consumed, in random \norder, test biscuits with glucomannan (0.5 g of glucomannan per 100 kcal of dietary intake, 8-13 g per \nday) or wheat bran fibre control biscuits for three weeks each separated by a 2-week washout (Vuksan \net al., 2000). No statistically significant differences in body weight changes were observed between \nthe glucomannan and the wheat bran fibre (control) interventions. In another study by the same \nauthors with identical design, no statistically significant differences in body weight changes were \nobserved between the glucomannan and the wheat bran fibre (control) interventions in a group of 11 \ntype 2 diabetic subjects (Vuksan et al., 1999). The Panel notes the small number of subjects included \nin these studies, the short study duration, and that glucomannan was not given as pre-load before the \nmeals but was rather consumed with the meals. \nIn a parallel-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study by Wood et al., (2007), \n30 overweight and obese men were randomly assigned to consume either glucomannan (3 g/d, n=15) \nor placebo (n=15) for 12 weeks in the context of a carbohydrate restricted diet for weight loss. No \nstatistically significant differences in body weight changes were observed between the glucomannan \nand the placebo groups. \nIn the study by Chen et al. (2003), 22 diabetic subjects (12 female) with elevated blood cholesterol \nconcentrations received, following a randomised, double-blind, crossover design, glucomannan and \nplacebo (starch) for 28 days each with no washout period in between. Glucomannan and placebo were \nadministered in gelatine capsules with a glass of water three times daily half an hour prior to meals. \nThe dose of glucomannan increased progressively from 1.2 (for three days), 2.6 (for three days) to \n3.6 g per day (for 22 days). No statistically significant differences in body weight changes were \nobserved between the glucomannan and placebo groups. The Panel notes the short duration of the \nstudy and the absence of a washout period between interventions.  \nThe Panel notes that no long-term studies (>3 months) on the effects of glucomannan on body weight \nare available.  \nThe Panel also notes that glucomannan is a soluble-type of fibre which forms a viscous, gel-like mass \nin the stomach when hydrated, and that this \u201cmass effect\u201d could delay gastric emptying and induce \nsatiety leading to a decrease in subsequent energy intake (Keithley and Swanson, 2005).  \nIn weighing the evidence, the Panel took into account that most of the intervention studies, which \nwere of adequate sample size and duration, found a statistically significant effect of glucomannan on \nbody weight loss in the context of a hypocaloric diet when administered as a pre-load before meals, \nand that the mechanism by which glucomannan could exert the claimed effect is established. \nPanel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the consumption of \nglucomannan and the reduction of body weight in the context of an energy-restricted diet. \n3.2. \nReduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses (ID 1559) \nA total of 10 references were submitted in relation to this claim. Six were textbooks and consensus \nopinions in relation to the health effects of dietary fibre in general, one was a narrative review on the \nhealth effects of dietary fibre in general, one was a narrative review on the potential health effects of \nglucomannan and two reported on human intervention studies investigating the effects of \nglucomannan on health outcomes other than post-prandial glycaemic responses (e.g. fasting plasma \nand glucose concentrations, long-term blood glucose control). Also, some intervention studies on the \neffects of glucomannan on post-prandial glycaemic responses in type 2 diabetic subjects under \npharmacological treatment for hyperglycaemia have been cited in relation to other claims on \nglucomannan. The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from these references for the \nscientific substantiation of the claimed effect.  \nOne reference submitted (Magnati et al., 1984) reported on a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-\nover intervention investigating the effects of glucomannan on post-prandial blood glucose responses \nduring an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 75 g glucose in 24 obese normoglycaemic subjects \n(19 females). No measures of insulin responses were reported. The Panel considers that no \nconclusions can be drawn from this study for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the \nconsumption of glucomannan and the reduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses.  \n3.3. \nMaintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations (ID 835, 3724) \nA total of 18 references were submitted in relation to this claim. Six were textbooks and monographs \nnot including original data on the effects of glucomannan on blood glucose control, one was a \nnarrative review on the health effects of dietary fibre in general, four were narrative reviews on the \npotential health effects of glucomannan including diabetes prevention and treatment, and one reported \non human intervention studies investigating the effects of glucomannan on health outcomes other than \npost-prandial glycaemic responses. In addition, one human intervention study investigating the effects \nof glucomannan on post-prandial blood glucose responses and four human intervention studies on the \neffects of glucomannan on medium-term blood glucose concentrations in type 2 diabetic subjects \nunder hypoglycaemic pharmacological treatment were presented. The Panel considers that no \nconclusions can be drawn from these studies for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect.  \nOnly one of the references provided was considered by the Panel as pertinent to the claim (Vuksan et \nal., 2000).  \nIn a cross-over randomised controlled trial (RTC), 11 non diabetic, mildly hypertensive, free-living \nsubjects with the insulin resistance syndrome (out of 278 subjects screened) consumed, in random \norder, test biscuits with glucomannan (0.5 g of glucomannan per 100 kcal of dietary intake, 8-13 g per \nday) or wheat bran fibre control biscuits for three weeks each separated by a 2-week washout (Vuksan \net al., 2000). A statistically significant decrease in plasma concentrations of fructosamine (a marker of \nblood glucose control) was observed with glucomannan compared to the wheat bran fibre control \n(between-group difference = 5.2\u00b11.4 %, p<0.002). Changes in fasting glucose and insulin \nconcentrations were not different between treatments. The Panel notes the small and highly selected \nsample of subjects recruited for this study, and that no evidence for a sustained effect was provided.  \nIn weighing the evidence, the Panel took into account that only one small intervention study of short \nduration on a highly selected population sub-group was presented for the substantiation of the claimed \neffect, and that no evidence on the sustainability of the effect was provided. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the \nconsumption of glucomannan and the maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations.  \n3.4. \nMaintenance of normal (fasting) blood concentrations of triglycerides (ID 3217) \nAmong the 22 references cited in the list in relation to this claim, most addressed the effects of \nfood/components other than glucomannan on claimed effects other than blood lipids. The Panel \nconsiders that no conclusions can be drawn from these references for the scientific substantiation of \nthe claim. \nSeven human studies which reported on the effects of glucomannan intake on blood concentrations of \ntriglycerides have been presented (Vuksan et al., 1999, 2000; Chen et al., 2003; Vido et al., 1993; \nWalsh et al., 1984; Vita et al., 1992; Wood et al., 2007). The study designs have been described in \nsection 3.1. Only one of the studies (Vita et al., 1992) reported a significant decrease in blood \nconcentrations of triglycerides after consumption of glucomannan compared to placebo at the end of a \nthree-month intervention, whereas five studies did not observe any differences between groups and \none study reports a significant increase in the glucomannan group after two months of intervention \n(Vido et al., 1993).  \nTwo animal studies cited in the list reported on changes in the lipid profile following consumption of \nglucomannan (Hou et al., 1990; Vorster et al., 1985). The Panel considers that the evidence provided \nin animal studies is not sufficient to predict the occurrence of an effect of glucomannan consumption \non maintenance of normal blood concentrations of triglycerides in humans. \nIn weighing the evidence, the Panel took into account that only one out of seven studies presented \nreported a significant decrease in plasma concentrations of triglycerides following consumption of \nglucomannan.  \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the \nconsumption of glucomannan and the maintenance of normal (fasting) blood concentrations of \n3.5. \nMaintenance of normal bowel function (ID 834, 1557, 3901) \nAmong the references provided for the scientific substantiation of the claim were five human \nintervention studies, three animal studies and several reviews and textbooks. \nIn all five human studies a commercial glucomannan preparation was studied.  \nMarzio et al. (1989) evaluated mouth to caecum transit time measured by hydrogen breath test in \nconstipated patients (n=13) after ingestion of glucomannan (daily dose 3 g). The Panel notes the small \nnumber of subjects in the study and the fact that the method used to assess transit time has several \nlimitations (Cummings et al., 2004). Subjects with chronic constipation (n=78) participated in the \nmulticentric, open and non-controlled study in which the effect of glucomannan (daily dose 2-3 g) on \nthe frequency of bowel movements and enema use, and on abdominal symptoms, was studied \n(Passaretti et al., 1991). The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from this uncontrolled \nstudy for the scientific substantiation of the claimed effect. In the single-blind sequential study of \nChen et al. (2006) glucomannan (daily dose 4.5 g) versus corn starch was given to eight subjects with \nlow dietary fibre intake (<20 g/day). The frequency of defecations (mean number/day\u00b1SEM) was \n1.1\u00b10.2 in the placebo period and 1.4\u00b10.2 in the glucomannan period (p<0.05). The Panel notes that \nthe study was single-blinded and non-randomised with a small number of subjects. The Panel \nconsiders that no conclusions can be drawn from this uncontrolled study for the scientific \nsubstantiation of the claimed effect. \nTwo studies were performed with chronically constipated children (Loening-Baucke et al., 2004; \nStaiano et al., 2000). Loening-Baucke et al. (2004) evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, cross-\nover study the effect of glucomannan (100 mg/kg body weight) on the frequency of bowel movements \nin a group of children with chronic constipation. The Panel notes the high drop out rate (only 31 from \n46 children completed the study), the fact that the children continued laxative treatment during the \nintervention period, and the fact that most of the children suffered also from encopresis accompanying \nconstipation. The Panel considers that no conclusions can be drawn from this study for the scientific \nsubstantiation of the claimed effect. In another study, glucomannan was given to a group of children \nwith severe brain damage (Staiano et al., 2000). The Panel considers that the evidence provided does \nnot establish that children with severe brain damage are representative of the general population with \nregard to the autonomous nervous system and therefore bowel function, nor that results obtained in \nstudies on subjects with severe brain damage can be extrapolated to the general population with \nregard to normal bowel function. \nThe Panel notes that no studies were provided from which conclusions could be drawn for the \nscientific substantiation of the claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the \nconsumption of glucomannan and the maintenance of normal bowel function. \n3.6. \nDecreasing potentially pathogenic gastro-intestinal microorganisms (ID 1558) \nAmong the 23 references provided for the scientific substantiation of the claim were five human \nintervention studies, two animal studies, seven reviews and nine textbooks or guideline opinions. \nThe human studies provided were related to endpoints not related to the claimed effect (e.g. stool \nbulk, intestinal transit time, abdominal comfort, number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria). The Panel \nconsiders that no conclusions can be drawn from these references for the scientific substantiation of \nthe claimed effect. \nThe Panel concludes that a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the \nconsumption of glucomannan and decreasing potentially pathogenic gastro-intestinal microorganisms. \n4. \n",
    "conditions_restrictions": " \n5.1.  \nReduction of body weight (ID 854, 1556, 3725) \nThe Panel considers that in order to obtain the claimed effect, at least 3 g of glucomannan should be \nconsumed daily in three doses of at least 1 g each, together with 1-2 glasses of water before meals, in \nthe context of an energy-restricted diet. The target population is overweight adults. \n",
    "conclusions": "  \nOn the basis of the data presented, the Panel concludes that: \uf0b7\n \nThe food constituent, konjac mannan (glucomannan), which is the subject of the health \nclaims, is sufficiently characterised.  \nReduction of body weight (ID 854, 1556, 3725) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effects are \u201cweight management\u201d and \u201ccontributes to weight management\u201d. The \ntarget population is assumed to be overweight subjects. Reduction of body weight is a \nbeneficial physiological effect for overweight individuals. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has been established between the consumption of \nglucomannan and the reduction of body weight. \uf0b7\n \nThe following wording reflects the scientific evidence: \u201cGlucomannan contributes to the \nreduction of body weight in the context of an energy-restricted diet\u201d. \uf0b7\n \nIn order to obtain the claimed effect, at least 3 g of glucomannan should be consumed daily in \nthree doses of at least 1 g each, together with 1-2 glasses of water before meals, in the context \nof an energy-restricted diet. The target population is overweight adults. \nReduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses (ID 1559) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201creduction of glycaemic response\u201d. The target population is assumed to \nbe individuals willing to reduce their post-prandial glycaemic responses. The reduction of \npost-prandial glycaemic responses may be a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of \nglucomannan and the reduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses. \nMaintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations (ID 835, 3724) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effects are \u201cglycaemic control\u201d and \u201ccontributes to maintain a healthy blood \nsugar level\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the general population. Long-term \nmaintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations is a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of \nglucomannan and the maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations. \nMaintenance of normal (fasting) blood concentrations of triglycerides (ID 3217) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201chelps to maintain physiological lipid levels in the blood\u201d. The target \npopulation is assumed to be the general population. Maintenance of normal (fasting) blood \nconcentrations of triglycerides may be a beneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of \nglucomannan and the maintenance of normal (fasting) blood concentrations of triglycerides. \nMaintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations (ID 3100, 3217) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effects are \u201chelps to maintain physiological lipid levels in the blood\u201d and \u201cheart \nhealth\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the general population.  \uf0b7\n \nA claim on glucomannan and the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations has \nalready been assessed with a favourable outcome.  \nMaintenance of normal bowel function (ID 834, 1557, 3901) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effects are \u201cbowel functions\u201d, \u201cintestinal health/bowel function\u201d and \u201cbowel \nfunction/colonic function\u201d. The target population is assumed to be the general population. \nMaintenance of normal bowel function in the context of a reduction in intestinal transit time \nand an increase in frequency of bowel movements within the normal range might be a \nbeneficial physiological effect. \uf0b7\n \nA cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of \nglucomannan and the maintenance of normal bowel function. \nDecreasing potentially pathogenic gastro-intestinal microorganisms (ID 1558) \uf0b7\n \nThe claimed effect is \u201cprebiotic action/bifidogenic action\u201d. The target population is assumed \nto be the general population.
